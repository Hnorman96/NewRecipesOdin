<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a salad that’s about as far as you can get from Western salads. No mayo! No oil in the dressing!<br>
    It’s a zingy and spicy cold salad made with green papaya, a fruit which might be unfamiliar to most Westerners.<br>
     Green papaya is simply unripened papaya, and has a juicy and slightly crunchy texture with a neutral taste.<br>
     More on green papaya below, including a surprise substitution option!
    When shredded, flavour clings to the green papaya.<br>
    The tangle of threads becomes the perfect vehicle for carrying the kaleidoscope of tastes in the dressing: sweetness from palm sugar, salty savouriness from the fish sauce and dried shrimp, fresh tang from lime, and fiery pungency from a generous one-two punch of garlic and chilli.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>1 ½ cups julienned green papaya, soak in ice water for 10-15 minutes until they are firmer<br>
    2 cloves garlic<br>
    Thai chilies, to taste<br>
    1 ½ Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped, packed<br>
    2-3 long beans, cut into 2-inch pieces<br>
    3 Tbsp roasted peanuts<br>
    1 heaping tablespoon small dried shrimp, roughly chop if you have large ones
    2 Tbsp fresh lime juice<br>
    2 tsp tamarind paste<br>
    1 ½ Tbsp fish sauce<br>
    ½ cup grape tomato halves or a small tomato cut into wedges<br>
    Serving suggestion: sticky rice and BBQ chicken are classic pairings with papaya salad!</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as little water on the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.</li>
        <li>In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).</li>
        <li>Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet paste and all the chunks are dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add long beans and pound just until they're broken</li>
        <li>Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce, tamarind paste, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime skin into the mortar as well for extra lime fragrance. Stir with a large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.</li>
        <li>Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip. Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes are just slightly crushed, it's done!</li>
        <li>Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts</li>
    </ol>
